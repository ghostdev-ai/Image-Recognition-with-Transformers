# Image Recognition with Transformers

Pytorch implementation of the, [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf).  This project demonstates how to replicate the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture as well as a comprehensive guide for how to replicate deep learning research papers in PyTorch.

## ViT Overview

Vision Transformers (Vit) is a transformer based approach for Image Classification.  It transforms an image into a learnable 1D token embedding and propagates through a standard Transformer encoder.
